Jack:
The midterm should be individual, with optional collaboration.
Time period should be two weeks, to allow time for somewhat complex development and allow students to perform to the best of their abilities

The midterm should require the use of git.


Cory:
Midterm preference would be individual work.
Time requirments would be 1-2 week time range. With a longer time period this allows for a student to complete the assignment without having to neglect other coursework. If a student has to learn a new peice of software such as XD the time period gives the student ample time to learn the new software and finsih the assignment.

The use of version control such as git as jack suggested is a good requirment.
